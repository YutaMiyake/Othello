CPU has three levels. Level 1 plays randomly. Level 2 and 3 play under minimax strategy with alpha-beta pruning given a different heuristic function. For level 2, a value is calculated by simply counting the number of pieces. For level 3, a value is calculated according to predefined matrix (e.g., corners are more valuable).
